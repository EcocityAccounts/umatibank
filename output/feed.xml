                <p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>How do I start a group in Umati Bank?   </li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>New groups can register directly here on the website.  Out admins,  Kiama, Ria and Geog are available to assist you through the process and they are available from the moment you sign up. Claudia Mbina Mwende (Mbindamwende@yahoo.co.ke) and Daniel Murithi (artatheart3839@gmail.com) are available to assist your group should your group require professional support or trainings.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Can a group collaborate with other stake holders?</li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>the Umati Bank provides assistance for groups to draft constitutions, MOU agreements, etc. Defining their relationship relative to NGOs, private investors and government institutions.  We provide connections to Kiva fund and Equity Bank foundation, but believe that it is smart to grow sustainably, build healthy small business dynamics through steady regular participation rather than following the traditional route of inferfacing with debt culture. We are a comunity that embraces a culture of savings and the benefits of mutual support and solidarity, so we encourage your group to honor one another and work to replace traditional bank loans, even if they are offered at 0% as we have seen from Equity Fund</li>
