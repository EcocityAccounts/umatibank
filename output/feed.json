We are a comunity that embraces a culture of savings and the benefits of mutual support and solidarity, so we encourage your group to honor one another and work to replace traditional bank loans, even if they are offered at 0% as we have seen from Equity Fund</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>Can a group register without a registration certificate?</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li>\n<p>Yes, one can register in Umatibank directly and begin the process of establishing your group be it a CBO, self help group, youth group, womens group, etc.  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>can mens groups' be registered?</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li> yes</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>How many members can register via Umatibank?</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li> Group size is ideally between 10 and 30 per group, but we are willing to make exceptions of you request a different option.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>What are the benefits after joining?</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li>Comunity banking is not a new concept and has been used to pool resources among trusted members of community for many years in many countries.
