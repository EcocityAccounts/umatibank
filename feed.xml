<p><strong>DIY / Kila Kitu / Upcycling</strong></p>
<p>Planning a project is an optimization equation where human, materials, transportation, and political considerations are all considered. Locally sourcing materials can be a matter of changing your design. Do you have any thoughts to share on how designs have changed over time to suit variability of supply. Innovation is driven by both necessity and the economic bottom line. Umati believes in removing barrie  </p>
