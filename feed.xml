<p><strong>Plastics Recycling</strong></p>
<p>preciousplastic.com has DIY systems for shredding, heat moulding, and extruding of sorted plastic waste.

<p><strong>Herbal Medicine Gardens / Everyday use of herbal medicines</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>DIY / Kila Kitu / Upcycling</strong></p>
<p>Planning a project is an optimization equation where human, materials, transportation, and political considerations are all considered. Locally sourcing materials can be a matter of changing your design. Do you have any thoughts to share on how designs have changed over time to suit variability of supply. Innovation is driven by both necessity and the economic bottom line. Umati believes in removing barrie  </p>
<p><strong>Environmental Cleanup &amp; RestorationTechniques</strong></p>
<p>Soil Production is a common benefit for value added farm systems. Compost amendments add nitrogen and carbon the the soil, reduce erosion, and increase crop vitality, drought resistence, available minerals and vitamins available from the produce.</p>
<p><strong> Musical and Creative Culture</strong></p>
<p> Creative work integrates well with the technical, business management, and numerical work that keeps modern businesses in thrive mode. Integrate more creative outlets.</p>
